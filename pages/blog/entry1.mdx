# Hello world!

This was published on {new Date(created_at).toLocaleString()}.
BTW, the difference between this article and the other one is that this is created as a
standalone MDX page within the NextJS pages tree, while the other is created as part
of a portable "content" folder.

export default ({ children }) => (
  // In the NextJS pages, the layout must be defined as an export.
  <>
    <Nav />
    <div className="profile">
      <ProfileCard />
      <ProfileNav />
    </div>
    <main>{children}</main>
  </>
);
