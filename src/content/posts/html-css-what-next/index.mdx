  Have you learned some HTML and CSS but feel like the website
  of your dreams (with a blog! a fancy gallery! a comments section!) is out of
  your reach? Here's a few options for your next steps!
---

## Outgrowing HTML and CSS

After building a few HTML pages, you may start to feel that your website dreams
are slowed down by repeated tasks, or that you're looking for more fanciful
interactivity than you know how to build. Your struggles might include (or look
similar to) these:

- Keeping your layout consistent across pages without repeating code. For
  example, you might want to automatically update your navigation on every page
  without changing the HTML on each of them.
- Automatically creating pages for each individual work in your galleries, or
  filtering them according to their tags.
- Allowing users to add their own content to your pages, be it in the form of a
  guestbook, a comment section, or even just a like on your post.

First of all, _congratulations!_ Your ambition is a sign of your growth as a
website weaver. At this point, for how intimidating that sounds, you might be
ready for the next step in web development: a foray into JavaScript-based tools,
and (if you wish) programming.

## So Many Pathways, So Little Time

Now, _bad news_: there's countless potential paths in front of you, and you
might find yourself confused and overwhelmed. But–_good news!_–every developer's
journey is unique (and rarely linear), and you're going to be fine no matter
which path you choose.

In this article, we'll discuss my favorite options:

1. The Static Site Generation Path (my reccommendation for fannish folks)
2. The Play Around in the Browser Path
3. The Server Path

You can choose one of them and follow it to the end, or you can jump around as
you wish. Often, you might find that the one that seems most appealing doesn't
end up being your favorite. Sometimes, you might find the one that didn't turns
out to be a lot of fun. Remember: if you don't like the choice you made, you can
go back and try a different one. Not only figuring out what you don't like is as
valuable as figuring out what you do, but all these choices build upon each
other. No learning is ever wasted.

> **NOTE:** If you're very ambitious, you might choose to start directly here, and
> learn HTML and CSS as you go. While some might caution you against it, as a
> fellow "throwing myself off the deep end" learner, I say: _don't let your
> dreams be dreams!_ For you, the Static Site Generation Path might be the right
> choice.

### The Static Site Generation Path

Let's say you like to produce content, _a lot of content_. This might look like
a website with many different pages, galleries with a lot of art, or even
frequent updates and improvements to your layout that need to be copy pasted on
each page. Maybe you _even_ wish to start a blog. Static Site Generators are the
perfect tool to tackle these challenges.

**A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a program that, rather than have you write each
page of your website by hand, stitches your files together and _generates_ those
pages for you.** For example, an SSG will allow you to:

- Define your own `<Navigation />` tag to add wherever you want your navigation bar
  to appear. This tag will be swapped with the HTML and CSS of your navigation when
  the SSG runs.
- Automatically add a new entry to your gallery for each image in a folder, making sure
  you never accidentally forget to add the new `img` tag to your HTML.

**In the end, an SSG will create the same HTML and CSS files you'd have written**, without
having you write the same code over and over again. These days, [the web's most darling Static Site Generator is Astro](https://astro.build/).
If their homepage seems too full of jargon and overwhelming for you, don't worry: you don't
need to understand any of those words to be able to use it.

#### Installing Astro

Here's how to get started:

<details>
  <summary>Content collapsed for your ease of scrolling past</summary>

1. **Learn how to open you Terminal (command line) and navigate to a folder:** many
   beginners (and some experts) are nervous about using the command line to run programs. In
   reality, **you can start using the command line without learning _any_ command.** Windows' Terminal is
   called PowerShell, and [you can open it in any folder by following this guide](https://adamtheautomator.com/windows-open-powershell-in-a-folder/#Opening_PowerShell_via_the_Address_Bar).
   There are similar guides for [Mac](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/how-can-i-open-a-terminal-window-directly-from-my-current-finder-location)
   or [Linux](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-101-how-to-quickly-open-a-terminal-in-a-specific-directory/).

   > **NOTE:** if you'd really, _really_ like to avoid using a Terminal, I suggest you go through the
   > ["Play Around in the Browser" path](#the-play-around-in-the-browser-path) instead.

2. **Install NodeJS with Node Version Manager (NVM):** NodeJS allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer
   (rather than in your browser). Astro, like many other program, is written in JavaScript
   and needs NodeJS to run. **Rather than installing NodeJS directly I suggest you
   use NVM ([Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#install-nvm-windows),
   [others](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).** NVM will install NodeJS for you, and allow you
   to switch between different versions whenever you need. It's a handy tool that will help
   you later. After installing NodeJS, **you can now run `npm` commands in your Terminal.**
3. **Install (and play around with) Astro**: Astro has an excellent [documentation website](https://docs.astro.build/)
   and a friendly Discord server for when you get stuck. Currently, **[the command to create your
   Astro website](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/) is `npm create astro@latest`.**
   Open your Terminal in the folder you want to create your website in, run this command, answer
   some questions, and you're done! Reopen your Terminal in the new folder (or `cd` into it)
   then run `npm run dev` to see your Astro website come to life.

</details>

#### Part 1: The Basics

From here, here's the learning path I suggest:

- **[Make some new
  pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/):** First, you
  can create some HTML pages in your `src/pages/` folder to see that all you
  know still works as you expect! Next, you can try creating some `.astro`
  pages, and (if you're a fan of markdown) even some `.md` ones. You can run
  `npm run dev` to see a preview of these pages
- **[Learn how to `build` your
  website](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/#building-your-site-locally)**:
  When your pages are done, you can run `npm run build` to generate your HTML
  and CSS pages. Explore the files in the newly-created `dist/` directory to see
  the code Astro built for you!
- **[Create a Component (without
  Props)](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/):** A Component is a
  reusable tag you can add to any `.astro` page in place of rewriting the same HTML. You can
  write _any_ component you wish, but if you cannot choose the Astro
  documentation has [a tutorial that guides you through creating a Navigation
  Bar](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/3-components/). Regardless of which
  component you choose to build, this is a good time to dive into them!
- **[Create your Layout](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/):**
  A step up from simple components, creating a layout will allow you to easily
  wrap the unique content of every page in the same HTML. The new concept you're
  looking to explore here is [the `<slot />`
  tag](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#slots).
- **[Create a Component (with
  props)](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#component-props):**
  props allow you to add custom attributes to Component tags you create! For
  example, you might create a `Card` that allows you to display information about your OCs,
  and use attributes for the data that changes between them, like their names, images, and
  descriptions.

#### Part 2: The slightly-less Basics

At this point, if you start feeling overwhelmed by the JavaScript required, it
might be worth temporarily switching to the ["Play Around in the
Browser"](#the-play-around-in-the-browser-path) path to beef up your skills.
Once you're comfortable with these, here's how you might proceed:

- **[Dynamic Routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes):** Dynamic
  routes allow you to automatically generate individual pages based on a list of
  data. For example, continuing the OC example, you might create an individual
  page for each character and make your cards link to it. The ["build a blog"
  Astro tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/) guides you
  through automatically generating a blog from a series of markdown files in a
  folder.
- **[Content
  Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#_top):**
  This is my favorite Astro feature, and one of the main reasons I so highly
  reccommend it. While this will require [some
  TypeScript](#making-the-glompjump-to-typescript), you don't need to fully know
  TypeScript to get benefits out of it. Long story short, content collections
  allow you to store all your content in a `src/content/` folder and make sure
  that all content in each collection has the same structure (for example, that
  all your blogpost have a title, or all your OCs have a favorite food). You can
  follow [Astro's Blog with Content Collections
  tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/#extending-the-blog-tutorial-with-content-collections)
  to learn more about them.
- **[Remark & Rehype Plugins](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#configuring-markdown-and-mdx):**
  once again, one of my favorite features (not just of Astro). If you're writing your content
  in markdown or MDX, you can install Remark and Rehype plugins to extend the capabilities
  of your markdown. For example, I use them to automatically generate the table of content
  in these pages, or to add emojis to my content :bobaparty: . (TODO: fix this)

#### Uploading your Website

Statically Generated websites can be easily published to websites like Neocities. After all,
once you run `npm run build`, the content within your `dist/` folder will be the same HTML
and CSS pages you will have written by hand! If you want to step up your game even further,
you can [learn how to use Git + GitHub](#the-always-worth-it-regadless-of-path) to automatically upload your website whenever you
create a new version.

### The Play Around in the Browser Path

Maybe you want to try JavaScript, but aren't yet ready to commit to all
the installation process that comes with making a jump to a more complex
build step like static site generation. Maybe you aspire to make single
pages more than complex set ups, and enjoy interactivity in your pages.

Here's a bit of what you should learn:

- Basic of code (variables, arrays, functions, objects)
- Logging values to console (invaluable for debugging)
- JavaScript event handlers
- DOM manipulation

An easy path for this would be to make something that changes when you click
a button. Pairing CSS animations with events is also fun.

### The Saving Data on the Server Path

This is the path for you if you're interested in getting into
talking with other services or storing and retrieving data (like comments).
There's many routes you can go through here, but I personally suggest:

- Get Astro
- Turn on SSR mode
- Watch our stuff on Forms, maybe use them with Discord Webhook
  - Link to article + video
- Learn SQLite (articles coming)

### The "Always Worth it, Regadless of Path"

- Learn Git & GitHub (follow FujoGuide for when our guide comes out)
- Figure out a good IDE (we reccommend VSCode)

## Next Up on Your Journey: Trial and Error, Mix and Match

These paths just give you an idea of what's possible. You don't need to follow
any linearly, and you can jump in and out and see what you prefer. If you're
discouraged, maybe you can try attacking it from a different side. The best
way to learn is to make a project that's just a bit outside of your comfort
zone and go from there (link to the other post).

While the road to mastering these abilities won't be simple, I believe that if
you stick with it you'll find yourself making progress quicker than you think,
earlier than you think. If you ever feel like there's no way you'll ever "get it",
don't despair: that's just how programming feels like sometimes! You can always
reach out to me on socials or during streams with any question.

## Making the ~~Glomp~~Jump to TypeScript

As you go through these you might sometimes hear about TypeScript. For the most
part, you don't need to worry about it. JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript
code. Wherever you can write TypeScript, you can write JavaScript (but not vice versa)
with maybe just a few more red squiggles.

What TypeScript does is it makes sure that what you have in your variables and what
you're passing to your function is right. While it can be scary, this is yet another
step up that can help you become a better and more efficient programmer, and write
more and more complex programs.

[the meme of the square hole with javascript and typescript]

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of great beginners friendly material to reccommend.
We did do a little bit here, but we'll also try to publish more soon.
