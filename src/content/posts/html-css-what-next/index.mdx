## Outgrowing HTML and CSS

After building a few HTML pages, you may start to feel that your website dreams
are being slowed down by repeated tasks, or that you wish to give your visitors
more fanciful interactions than you can figure out how to build. These
difficulties might include (or look similar to) these:

- Keeping your layout consistent across pages without repeating code. For
  example, you might want to automatically update your navigation on every page
  without changing the HTML on each of them.
- Filtering images in your gallery according to their tags, or automatically
  creating pages for each individual work in the gallery.
- Allowing users to add their own content to your pages, be it in the form of
  a guestbook, a comment section, or even just a like on your post.

First of all, _congratulations!_ Your ambition is a sign of your growth as a
website weaver. At this point, for how intimidating that sounds, you might be
ready for the next step in web development: a foray into the world of
JavaScript-based tools and (if you wish) programming.

## So Many Pathways, So Little Time

From here, there are a lot of paths this journey can take you in. While everyone's
path is unique and rarely linear, here's a few you can pick and choose from:

1. The Static Site Generation Path (the one I reccommend most people start with)
2. The Play Around in the Browser Path
3. The Server Path

This article is an overview of the potential roads in front of you. You can
choose one of them and follow it to the end, or you can jump around as you wish.
Often you might find that the one that seems most appealing doesn't end up being
your favorite.

### The Static Site Generation Path

Let's say you want to produce content, _a lot of content_.
You want your website to have a lot of pages, you want your
content to have many types, you want your galleries to have a
lot of art. Maybe you _even_ want a blog.

Here's what you should do:

- NVM
- Astro:
  - Components
  - Content Collections (some basics of code will be helpful here)
  - Remark & Rehype Plugins

You can do this with Neocities. You can also connect Git and get a
GitHub account, and get the joy of automatically getting your updates
when you push it.

By this point, you should know how to install NPM packages. Next up,
you can search around GitHub for plugins to install.

### The Play Around in the Browser Path

Maybe you want to try JavaScript, but aren't yet ready to commit to all
the installation process that comes with making a jump to a more complex
build step like static site generation. Maybe you aspire to make single
pages more than complex set ups, and enjoy interactivity in your pages.

Here's a bit of what you should learn:

- Basic of code (variables, arrays, functions, objects)
- JavaScript event handlers
- DOM manipulation

An easy path for this would be to make something that changes when you click
a button. Pairing CSS animations with events is also fun.

### The Saving Data on the Server Path

This is the path for you if you're interested in getting into
talking with other services or storing and retrieving data (like comments).
There's many routes you can go through here, but I personally suggest:

- Get Astro
- Turn on SSR mode
- Watch our stuff on Forms, maybe use them with Discord Webhook
  - Link to article + video
- Learn SQLite (articles coming)

### The "Always Worth it, Regadless of Path"

- Learn Git & GitHub (follow FujoGuide for when our guide comes out)
- Figure out a good IDE (we reccommend VSCode)

## Next Up on Your Journey: Trial and Error, Mix and Match

These paths just give you an idea of what's possible. You don't need to follow
any linearly, and you can jump in and out and see what you prefer. If you're
discouraged, maybe you can try attacking it from a different side. The best
way to learn is to make a project that's just a bit outside of your comfort
zone and go from there (link to the other post).

## Making the ~~Glomp~~Jump to TypeScript

As you go through these you might sometimes hear about TypeScript. For the most
part, you don't need to worry about it. JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript
code. Wherever you can write TypeScript, you can write JavaScript (but not vice versa)
with maybe just a few more red squiggles.

What TypeScript does is it makes sure that what you have in your variables and what
you're passing to your function is right. While it can be scary, this is yet another
step up that can help you become a better and more efficient programmer, and write
more and more complex programs.

[the meme of the square hole with javascript and typescript]

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of great beginners friendly material to reccommend.
We did do a little bit here, but we'll also try to publish more soon.
