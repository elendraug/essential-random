## GetStaticPath in Astro (and theoretically Next)

### The problem it solves

Static Site Generators (SSGs) don't create pages on demand when a visitor
requests them. Instead, they generate them all ahead of time–the so-called
_"build time"_–before your site is uploaded to the web. This causes a
problem for "dynamic routes", the pages that have parameters within their
URLs: **if an URL is of the form `/posts/[postSlug]`, what are all the possible
valid values that `[postSlug]` can have?** Knowing this is essential to knowing what
pages need to be generated, and is the question that `getStaticPaths` exists to answer.

## `getStaticPaths` and URL parameters

When an SSG goes to generate a page with a dynamic parameter, it looks at the
code within in search of an _exported_ function (the only ones it can see)
named `getStaticPaths`. Once called, this function will give the SSG the list of
all the pages it needs to work its magic on. The form this list takes is **an
array made up of one JavaScript object per page with the values of the
URL parameter(s) for that page.**

Speaking in TypeScript terms this will be:

```ts
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

type ParametersForEachPage = Array<{
  params: PageParameters;
}>;

// A function that takes no inputs, and returns ParametersForEachPage.
type getStaticPaths = () => ParametersForEachPage;
```

Or, for a concrete example:

```ts
// Since getStaticPaths often uses data that is loaded via network
// or filesystem request, the function will be async and the return
// value wrapped in a promise. If you don't know what that means,
// just ignore it.
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<ParametersForEachPage> {
  return [
    { params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" } },
    { params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
    { params: { postSlug: "thirstposting-as-bonding-activity" } },
  ];
}
```

This will generate 3 pages:

1. `/posts/my-shipping-manifesto`
2. `/posts/ypescript-is-your-friend-i-swear`
3. `/posts/thirstposting-as-bonding-activity`

## `getStaticPaths` and props

There is yet another thing that `getStaticPaths` can do for you: given that it
already has to work to produce the value of the URL parameters for every page (a
task that might require potentially-intensive computations), wouldn't it be neat
if it could use that chance to also **tell the SSG about the dynamic properties
("`props`") of each page**?

In our blog example, these could be `tags`, `title`, `created_at`, and mostly
anything we want to avoid having to recalculate later. The SSG doesn't really
care what `props` you give it (and if you give any), and it will simply pass
them as-is to each page as it goes to create it, similarly to how we manually
pass props to components.

The signature will then become:

```ts
type GetStaticPathReturnValue = Array<{
  params: {
    postSlug: string;
  };
  props: {
    tags: string[];
    title: string;
    created_at: Date;
  };
}>;
```

and our function call:

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<GetStaticPathReturnValue> {
    return [
        // Our shipping post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" },
            props: {
                tags: ["fandom", "shipping"],
                title: "Why I am Right and You are All Wrong",
                created_at: new Date('December 31, 2023 23:59:00')
            }
        },
        // Our typescript-defense-squad post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
            props: {
                tags: ["coding", "typescript", "beginners"],
                title: "Be kind to him, he's just trying to help",
                created_at: new Date('January 5, 2024 16:20:00')
            }
        },
        // And so on so on...
    ];
}
```

Note that (unlike params, which the SSG _needs_ to work) props is completely
optional: if we preferred to, we could simply load the post data again in the
page itself by using the value in the `postSlug` URL parameter. "Props" is simply a
"since we're here, we might as well" convenience.

## `getStaticPaths` and content collections

In Astro, `getStaticPaths` is often used in tandem with content collections. There's
nothing particularly special about using `getStaticPaths` this way, but let's go through
it bit by bit to make sure what's happening is clear.

Once again, our goal is to let the SSG know about:

1. The value of `postSlug` for each one of our posts
2. The properties that change page by page (we'll assume this is
   every property of `entry.data`, plus the function to render the content)

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // If you're already loading this in the page itself, you cannot reuse it here:
  // assume that getStaticPaths exists on its own and has no access to anything else
  // on the file you're writing and can only see what's written within it.
  const blogEntries = await getCollection("posts");
  // Given an array, map will run the function for each entry, and put the returned
  // value in a new array (with the same position).
  return blogEntries.map((blogPost) => {
    return {
      // Content collections give us a nice slug for each entry, kindly
      // precalculated for us
      params: { postSlug: blogPost.slug },
      //
      props: {
        // Our props "content" will contain the function to render the blog
        // post. Rather than calling the function we simply put the function itself
        // into the renderContent property, like we do with every other varialbe.
        renderContent: blogPost.render,
        // We spread the content of blogPost.data in the returned object, so that
        // we have a prop for each value in the data, rather than the whole data
        // as a single object.
        ...blogPost.data,
      },
    };
  });
}
```

The result of calling this `getStaticPaths` is similar to the one above: an array with
one entry for each entry in your collection, with the value of the `postSlug` URL
parameter, and `props` that contain the dynamic data for each page.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<GetStaticPathReturnValue> {
    return [
        // Our shipping post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" },
            props: {
                renderContent: /*a function to render the blogpost content*/,
                tags: ["fandom", "shipping"],
                title: "Why I am Right and You are All Wrong",
                created_at: new Date('December 31, 2023 23:59:00')
            }
        },
        // Our typescript-defense-squad post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
            props: {
                renderContent: /*a function to render the blogpost content*/,
                tags: ["coding", "typescript", "beginners"],
                title: "Be kind to him, he's just trying to help",
                created_at: new Date('January 5, 2024 16:20:00')
            }
        },
        // And so on so on...
    ];
}
```

## How do I use these values in my pages?

Astro has its own way to get these values in your page, using the special `Astro` object
that is available in every `.astro` file. Simply access the `params` and `props` elements
in this object to get your values.

### Params

```ts
// Remember: this destructuring is equivalent to
// const postSlug = Astro.params.postSlug;
const { postSlug } = Astro.params;
```

### Props

For props, this is exactly the same as it would be in any component:

```astro
---
const { renderContent, tags, title, created_at } = Astro.props;

// If you want to use the rendered content you can render it and
// then use it as any other tag. Note we capitalize the first letter
// of content to remind ourself that's a component.
const Content = await renderContent();
---

{title}
Published on: {created_at}

<Content />
```

## Final TypeScript typing

Here's the final typescript types of the whole thing, which (if you've surrendered
to the power of our Lord TypeScript) will help you remember how the concepts are related:

```ts
type GetStaticPathReturnValue = Array<{
  params: {
    postSlug: string;
  };
  props: {
    // Remember: this is an asynchronous function, so it returns a Promise that
    // wraps around the actual return value.
    Content: () => Promise<AstroComponent>;
    tags: string[];
    title: string;
    created_at: Date;
  };
}>;

// The type of Astro.params will then be the same as the type of
// params in GetStaticPathReturnValue
type AstroParams = {
  postSlug: string;
};

// And the type of Astro.props will then be the same as the type of
// props in GetStaticPathReturnValue
type AstroProps = {
  Content: () => Promise<AstroComponent>;
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};
```

...and that is all! Go forth and use the power of `getStaticPaths` and let me know
if anything is unclear.
