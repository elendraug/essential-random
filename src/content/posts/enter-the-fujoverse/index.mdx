## What is the ~~Boba~~FujoVerse™

The FujoVerse™[^1]–previously known as The BobaVerse™[^2]–is "an eclectic collection of
projects related to coding, community and fandom[^3] on the web". This article gives an
eagle-eye-view of the ecosystem and how it means to accomplish its goal: **turning the
web back into a place of fun, joy, and connection whose dwellers feel empowered to build
their own communities and software.**

## The Pillars: Community, Software Ownership, and Technical Education

The FujoVerse™ projects have evolved over time, based on what I learned building
each piece, connecting with allies, and reading about related subjects. While
it's known that ambituous goals don't do well with fixed roadmaps, there are a
few pillars these efforts hover around. You can read more about individual
projects on [my projects page](/projects).

### Community

Many things contribute to making the modern web a "joyless landscape", but **the
lack of _true communities_ is a core and often underestimated issue.** While the
hyper-connectedness of contemporary online social spaces can trick people into
seeing these as communities, their present shape hinders rather than helps
people in building a shared group identity and norms[^4].

As research shows, the lack of true community heavily contributes to loneliness
and social isolation we feel in the modern days, even in the online world. This
adds to the disenfranchisement felt by many, and keeps online dwellers
disempowered and stuck in a loop of helpless, often-misdirected anger at one
another.

### Software Ownership and Collaboration

The needs of niche online communities are, well, _niche_. While software built
by large tech companies is increasingly at odds even with the needs of
mainstream users, this is doubly true for people who belong to marginalized
groups and communities. **To build software that caters to their needs, niche
communities need to be able to shape this software on their own.**

Doing so, however, is not only a technical challenge: it also necessitates
building structures and processes for constructive collaboration, both within
each community and accross different ones. Unfortunately, **effective
collaboration requires both trust and psychological safety.** As communities
erode, and the web and social systems break down, building safe and stable
spaces for collaborative work becomes an even thornier problem than it has
historically been.

### Education (Technical and Beyond)

To build and maintain their own software tools, members of niche online
communities need the skills and know-how to do so. Unfortunately, the
overwhelming majority of education material for web development either targets
people who want to start a professional career, or hardly moves past simple HTML
and CSS pages (with a sprinke of basic JavaScript). **To change the web, we need
highly-technical educational material that speaks the language of hobbyists**, and
bridges the gap between beginner and intermediate web development.

The need for education, however, goes beyond the technical realm. From community
building to conflict resolution, from negotiation to effective (and kind)
communication to project management, **niche communities will need many
different skills to build a better future for themselves and the web.** This
road is much harder without approachable and trusted resources to learn them
from.

> Note: In more than one way, these pillars also intersect with _open source software_
> and _decentralized protocols_.

## The Future: Help Build the FujoVerse™

Despite all that we've already built, **The FujoVerse™ is still in its
inception.** We have a long road ahead of us to be able to pay the collaborators
that make our project possible, and continue our work beyond 2024. To this end,
**this year I'm focused on building a larger public and finding new supporters
and sponsors.** If you believe in The FujoVerse™ mission, you can support it
[on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) or [by subscribing to
my own newsletter](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me#donate). If
you wish to donate more, you can [reach out to set up a custom
sponsorship](mailto:essential.randomn3ss@gmail.com).

In the long term, given the opportunity and finances to do so, **we believe that we
can build profitable projects that will be able to sustain our mission.** After
all, the people who contribute to The FujoVerse™ have a unique perspective that
speaks to the needs of the web and its netizens in a way that no mainstream
company can replicate.

While the road to manifesting and harnessing this vision
will be difficult, nothing ambitious ever looked easy from the starting point.

    "Fandom" should be considered a stand-in for "_niche online community_". While
    my work centers around ["transformational/shipping fandom"](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Transformational_Fandom)
    (because that's my own online niche), the projects and lessons are applicable beyond its
    boundaries.
