## A Historical View of the FujoVerse™

The progenitor of the FujoVerse™ is [BobaBoard](/projects/bobaboard), the first
project I launched after starting this whole journey. Keeping things short and
simple, its goal was to **create a modernized version of old-school forums to
help niche online communities carve fanced-off spaces for themselves** out of an
increasingly "everyone smushed together" web. The test, invite-only BobaBoard
community launched a few months after the original announcement, and has now
been successfully chugging along for a few years.

As the project proceeded, however, it became clear that **many people who wished
to help did not know how to contribute to an open-source project, or work on a
large codebase based on modern web technologies** (e.g. React, TypeScript, and
NextJS). This was particularly true of BobaBoard's original target audience:
["transformational fandom"](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Transformational_Fandom):
unlike other niche online communities (like furries), transformational fandom
doesn't have a large population of highly-technical folks–at least, not one large
enough to support such an ambitious project.

  <summary>Why is BobaBoard not here?</summary>
  Because generating revenue from open source community software is ethically fraught,
  especially when you're targeting niche online communities. This will be its own
  article, at some point.
