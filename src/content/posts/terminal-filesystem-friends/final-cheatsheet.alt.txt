A doodle of a tree of folders. At the top is one named with just a slash mark.
A cat is sleeping on top, marked as "git sleeping". The subtitle of the folder is 
"the root".

It branches out to two unnamed folders on each side and one below marked users/. 
On the folder on the right side is terminal, fighting with a cat marked as 
"github hissing". GitHub is sitting on top of a folder labeled with .hidden.

Under users/ is the boba-tan/ folder, with a subtitle of "your home" and a tilde.
Under boba-tan/ is art/, and to its left is code/. Near code is boba-tan herself
working on her laptop, labeled current position, with a dot. Near the arrow from 
the code/ folder to the boba-tan/ folder is the label "parent directory", with two dots.

On the side a box reads:
Where am I? pwd
Whatâ€™s here? ls
Move away: cd
