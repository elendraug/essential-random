A sketch of Boba-tan looking across a landscape with a large icon for the
program Word on the horizon, next to a shadowed figure labeled “A OS character
(which we don’t have)”. At the bottom corner is the icon for the Finder program
for MacOS. It’s set up to be a reference to an Evangelion screenshot with two
people looking across a landscape with a large face in the sky.
