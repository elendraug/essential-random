A sketch of Boba-tan looking across a landscape with a large icon for a file
from program Word on the horizon. At the bottom corner is the icon for the
Finder program for MacOS, marked as "alt". Next to boba-tan is a black figure
sitting marked as "an OS character (which we don't have)".

Itâ€™s set up to be a reference to an Evangelion screenshot with two people
looking across a landscape with a large face in the sky.
