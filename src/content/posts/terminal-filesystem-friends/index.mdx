## What's a File System, anyway?

You can think of data on a disk as a primordial soup of `0`s and `1`s. While all the
information you have saved does exist somewhere on the disk, it cannot be retrieved
without an operating system to give it "shape". The part of the operating system in
charge of turning this formless data into files is called **the file system**[^-1].

### What File Systems Do

Aside from knowing how to retrieve the content of a file from the disk it's saved on, a
file system also maintains various additional data about each of them. For example, a
file system might know when a file was created, when it was last accessed, or which user
"owns" the file.

However, the most "popular" function of the filesystem is to maintain a
human-readable way to organize–one might say _file away_–the user data. The way
it does this is by assigning each file a path that places it somewhere within a
system of `directories` (also called `folders`[^0]).

### Folders, directories and paths

An easy way to think of folders and directories is to think about the real-life concepts
they're modeled after.

#### The folders metaphor

If you imagine each file as an actual sheet of paper, you can imagine
using a paper `folder` to collect related files (and maybe even other `folder`s) together. You can
imagine placing `file`s within `folder`s, within `folder`s, within `folder`s, until you end up with
a single `folder` at the top that contains all the `file`s and `folder`s in your system.

#### The directories metaphor

</figure>

Similarly, you could imagine placing yourself somewhere in your system and search for a file. To do so,
you might consider consulting a `directory` listing every file and its position in the system. At every
level you visit, there would be a new `directory` indicating the next direction to go towards, until you
find what you were looking for.

#### Finding your Path

Eventually, the road you take within `directories` or `folders` to get to a file is called its `path`. The
folders in a path are separated by the `/` sign. When you see a `/` sign at the end of a word, that's generally
a sign that you're talking about a directory.

### The File System Tree

Regardless of which metaphor works best for you, the end result is the same type of structure, one
computer scientists everywhere love: a tree[^1].

[Tree diagram]

Just like these tree-structures, the file system also uses specific metaphors:

- **Root:** The top-level folder, where it all starts from. In Unix systems (MacOS & Linux)
  this is called `/`. On windows, you often have multiple roots (for separate disks or disk
  partitions) each named with a letter. The most common name is `C:/`.
- **Parent:** Each folder, aside from the `root`, has a folder that contains it: this is its
  parent. Computer scientists generally call the nodes within a parent its children, but this
  is not as popular in files.
- **Subdirectory/Subfolder:** If you put a `folder` within a `folder`, that's called a `subdirectory`
  of the parent folder.

Do not talk to me or my subdirectory, or my subdirectory subdirectory, or my subdirectory ever again.

#### Home Sweet Home (`~`)

</figure>

One of the most important folder for a user is its home. Different users on a computer will all have
their own homes, which are usually inaccessible to one another. The symbol for home is `~`.

On Windows, the home is generally under [todo], where you find your `Documents/` folder. On Unix
systems, this changes but will be `/usr/[username]`.

#### Hidden files and folders

Folders and files can be hidden to make things more tidy. In Unix systems, these are prefixed with a `.`.
These are often configuration files (like `.env`) or folders (like `.git/`).

## Moving across the file system, Terminal Edition

If you're starting a terminal journey, one of the most important thing you can do is learn to move around
the filesystem. There are a few simple operation you can learn that will make moving around a breeze.

Windows used to have its own unique commands, but it has adapted to the Unix style. If you're using PowerShell
(you should), then most of the Unix commands will be available to you[^2].

### Oh, user, where art thou? (`pwd`)

The first, most important question is: where am I? To answer this, you can use the `pwd` command. `pwd` stands
for **P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory, but if you need another mnemonic I propose "**P**ardon, **W**hich **D**irectory (is this)?"

This will show you the `path` you're currently at.

### Show Me Your ~~Secrets~~ Files! (`ls`)

To list the files, you can use the `ls` command. `ls` stands for **l**i**s**t, but if you need another mnemonic, I
suggest "**L**et's **S**ee".

One thing about `ls` is that by itself it doesn't show hidden files (the ones starting with `.`). If you want to
force it, you'll have to give it a flag. You can do this by typing `ls -a`, where `a` stands for "all".

### Beam me anywhere, Scotty (`cd`)

To go to a different place, you can use the `cd` command. `cd` stands for **C**hange **D**irectory, and if you need a
different mnemonic you're out of luck cause I really can't do better than that.

Some secrets about `cd` is that you can use `cd -` to go to the last place you were, or `cd ~` to go to your home
directory. You can generally use `~` wherever you want not to type the whole path to that folder.

## A bit more about paths

Paths are very important, and mastering the art of paths will make your journey easier.

### Special Paths

- `.`: your current directory
- `..`: your parent directory
- `/`: the root directory
- `~`: the home

### Absolute vs Relative Paths

- Absolute paths start from the root (`/`). `~` is also an absolute way of indicating a path.
- Relative paths start from where you're at in the Terminal (the output of `pwd`). `.` is generally
  implied, but you'll often see `..`. This can be further combined, for example you can use `cd ../..`
  to go visit grandpa.

### Paths and commands

`ls` and `cd` work with both absolute and relative paths. Here's some examples.

#### A side note about file extensions

Generally, file systems don't care much about extensions and are more of a convenience for the user,
and to associate a file with the program that opens it.

## Final diagram

Here's a final diagram that might help you orientate yourself.

There's a lot to say about file systems, but this is a good overview of all you might need to know
to start exploring them from a command line.

[^-1]:
    While there's a lot of different types of file systems (you might have heard of `FAT` or
    `NTFS`), their differences don't generally matter to most users, even programmers.

[^0]: Theoretically there's a difference, but practically there's not. Don't even worry about it.
