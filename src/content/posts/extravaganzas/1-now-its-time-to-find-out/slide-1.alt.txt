A "Tumblr-style" slideshow, presented by Ms Boba. The text throughout is in
whimsical Comic Sans, as is Tumblr tradition. The deck is primarily grey text on
a white background, wiht memes throughout. 

The intro slide has its title information blocked out by additional orange Comic
Sans on angled text boxes with black fill, as if tape or sticky notes are
covering up the very slide itself.
