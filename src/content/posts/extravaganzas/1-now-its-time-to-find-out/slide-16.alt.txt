Slide 16:

The Challenge of Scaling Up

scaling = going from a place where ms boba can oversee everything to a place
where she leans on others to take charge, lead, or generally  work more
independently

it’s a really exciting time, and also a TON of very hard, very nebulous work

(unfortunately) not coding

1. Creating processes that can be sustained by teams of volunteers and one
extremely busy full-timer

2. Getting our legal and organizational ducks in order while navigating the lack
of resources and guidance

“hi mx. lawyer, yes, I’d like to run a nonprofit org that does both community
software and tech education and also has a bunch of satellite for-profit
endeavors so it can attempt to make profits to then reinvest in talent within
the community, also no, I don’t want to own this forever, I want it to grow to
be its own thing once I can trust it can stand on its own feet to go become
something I can be proud of having built, no, wait, why are you hanging up-”

some of the lawyers I got in touch with clearly thought I was deranged tbh

(to be fair, it’s not NOT true)

(she says, in comics sans)

3. Clearly articulating culture and norms to smooth out onboarding and ensure
culture fit

4. Welcoming and withstanding change, while managing the “people problems” that
come with it
