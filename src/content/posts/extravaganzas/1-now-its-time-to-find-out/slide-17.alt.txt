Slide 17:

To the right is an image of Waluigi striking a pose and holding a rose that he
appears to be almost licking. Above him is pink text with a black background:
"me when I'm #winning"

Current Ws (Note: "wins", and a Waluigi joke)

we’ve really grown into a much more cohesive unit since we’ve started our sprint
& retrospective process

1. The BobaBoard coders volunteer team has had “our most productive sprint yet”

our current sprint is aptly named “it’s a marathon not a sprint sprint” though

the goal is to NOT do heroics to launch quickly, but to find a process that will
help us successfully collaborate in the long run

2. We raised $18k+ to write educational material for Git & GitHub

idk if you’ve heard….

3. Fandom Coders is a thriving resource for beginners and experienced coders
alike

the Personal Website Club is THRIVING

and also teaching me a lot about where people’s difficulties are and what we
must do to smooth them out

4. More and more recurring collaborators

There's an arrow pointing to "recurring" that's labelled "friend-shaped 💜" with
a purple heart to match Waluigi.
