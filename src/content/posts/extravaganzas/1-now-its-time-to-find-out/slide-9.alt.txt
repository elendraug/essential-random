Slide 9:

The risk: move fast and break everything

(a.k.a, “how it’s usually done”)

(and how we’ll also do it if we’re not careful)

To the left, the Planeteers using their powers combined to summon Captain
Planet. Clockwise from the left: Gi, labeled "software that started decaying the
instant it was written"; Wheeler, labeled "a brittle organization struggling to
grow from its inevitable failures"; Linka, labeled "a disenfranchised user base
with no path to meaningful ownership of the software"; Kwame, labeled "an
increasingly hostile and culturally-divided web"; and Ma-Ti, labeled "the heroic
efforts of a small group of increasingly burned-out people". Captain Planet is
labeled "sustainable community software (for fandom)" but "sustainable" is
additionally covered up by "burnout-powered".

note: I KNOW it looks like im subtweeting but istg i would have written this the
same way 6 months ago

this is just the natural state human organizations trend towards, everything is
on a constant path towards rot

tbh 99.9% of people skilled enough to coordinate the work of large/complex
organizations don't do it in their spare time for free, they get paid a shit-ton
of money for it 

which is of course not an excuse to ignore problems, in a way it makes it even
more important not to sweep issues under the rug and figure out how to work
through them successfully, but STILL

pls dont kill me, think of my kittens
