Slide 10:

what we’re trying instead (extreme WIP edition)

i call it “take it slow and pray” ("and pray" is struck out)

1. Kickstart a series of aspirationally-independent software, educational,
and/or community initiatives that are of interest to niche online communities

2. Use these initiatives to train the niche user base in the skill needed to
continue maintaining and improving them (starting with transformative fandom!
incredibly strategical reason: it’s the niche I’m personally in)

2a. Enable motivated members of the userbase to have direct impact on the
direction of each project (and to go start their own)

2b. Lower costs and nurture the community by offering skill-training from
experts in exchange for help (intrinsic motivation, baby)

2c. Get to play that “diversity initiative” card when asking for grants
(education grants = take focus away from BobaBoard itself, making it less likely
that we’ll have to justify the proliferation of a/b/o on it)

3. Reinvest income resulting from donations + for-profit projects that might
(one day) hit it big, and continue nurturing that ecosystem 

3a. With the support of a small, core team of skilled, full-time, paid personnel
(which we aren’t even close to affording right now, money is the bit that keeps
me up at night tbh, my bank account has been falling for so long that (insert
Loki joke this slide is too overdue to finish) ANYWAY, more later

3b. Source core team and contract talent from the community grown at step #2 to
reduce risk and ensure cultural alignment, repeat, profit

…aka, “The BobaVerse™”
