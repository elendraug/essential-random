Supporters Q&A (thank you, love you all) (Note: Support is again written with a dollar sign)

On the right-hand side is a meme of a golden retriever wearing goggles, surrounded by chemistry gear, pouring the contents of a flask int oa coffee mug. The usual "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING" is altered to read, "I HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT I'M DOING" with the "SOME" written in Comic Sans.

to be clear, the memes are not going anywhere

as they say, “if you wanna be my public, you gotta get with my memes”
