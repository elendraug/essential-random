Slide 7:

Where Are We At: BobaVerse™ Edition

in case you lost track of all we’ve been working on until now

(you’d be extremely excused)

let’s just say it’s been an intense… 3 years or so

BEHOLD, the BobaVerse™!

A Venn diagram of sorts, with overlapping circles in the center ("Long-term
projects" and "April 1st jokes") as well as a rectangle on the left ("Test boba
galaxy") that partially overlaps with Long-term projects, and another square off
to the right ("side projects") that does not overlap with anything else. 

Long-term projects contains the logos for BobaBoard and Fandom Coders (a pair of
lime green braces that enclose the statement "if fandom then coding"), and in
pink text the comment "ms boba getting paid for her time, aka "Patron income"
(again, thank you)". 

The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development spans across the intersection of Long-term
projects and April 1st jokes. 

April 1st jokes also includes the logo for FujoBoard (Boba-tan licking her lips)
and purple text for RobinBoob by BobaBoard.

Fandom Coders is located where the "Test boba galaxy" rectangle overlaps with
Long-term projects. Also within the rectangle are "the Boobies" (BobaBoard
enthusiasts, represented by a real-life photo of the marine birds blue-footed
boobies.

In the "side projects" square are AO3.js (in the red and white scheme of Archive
of Our Own) and Tim the Enchanter from Monty Python and the Holy Grail [**VALE
WHY IS HE HERE??**].

“The BobaVerse™ is an eclectic collection of projects related to coding,
community and fandom on the web that may or may not create a sustainable
ecosystem one day” — definition ms boba just made up on the fly but that
actually kinda works
