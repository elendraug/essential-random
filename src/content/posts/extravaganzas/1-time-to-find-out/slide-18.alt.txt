To the right is an image of Mr. L, a brainwashed version of Luigi from Super
Paper Mario. He's wearing an alternate version of his signature outfit, with a

Current Ls (Note: "losses", and a Luigi joke)

Ms Boba Fucks Around and finds out that promoting a kickstarter campaign is an
incredibly huge amount of work

(im so proud of what we have achieved, the team has worked incredibly hard and
we made something so ambitious happen with so little resources)

redundancy and ms boba-brand Miracles™ (which also come at a cost)
