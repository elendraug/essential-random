Slide 13:

It’s Time to Find Out

The slide is set up as the "WHO WOULD WIN?" meme, pitting "an exceedingly ambitious project born out of hubris and frustration with the state of web and fandom
" against "my need to pay rent"

in short: “can ms boba (& pals) pull this whole thing off before her money runs out and she has to go back to sell her soul for money?” (sometime at the start of ~2024, at the current rate (see 2022 retro))

alternatively, can ms boba manage to get enough support to at least cover her rent and buy herself some more time?
