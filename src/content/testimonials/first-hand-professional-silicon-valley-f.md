I don't know anyone else working on a nascent fandom project that has both
first-hand professional Silicon Valley FAANG expertise on the tech side and
"trash panda" expertise on the fandom side. This makes Ms. Boba uniquely positioned
to responsibly and competently wield the necessary Big Tech skills (such as
networking + recruiting + estimating + training, and other "starting/running a
tech project" needs) for a fandom tech-based
passion project.
