The sheer amount of work and effort Ms. Boba has put into building BobaBoard is staggering, and I am not referring to the coding or any of the technical aspects. Ms. Boba is ACTUALLY working her ass off to build a community and helping break down the obstacles that stop people from becoming involved or succeeding, she's not just someone excited about their shiny new toy or trying to sell a product. Ms. Boba is clearly in it for the long haul, and it gives me a lot of hope that a lot of good can come out of BobaBoard.
