title: "Spring cleanup: Website(s) odds & ends"
description: |
  It's time for a spring cleanup! We have big things planned for the
  FujoVerse this year, and we must prepare to accomodate new friends
  with the polish and fanfare they deserve. In these streams, we'll look
  around our websites for things to clean up and improve, and learn more 
  about HTML, CSS and JS as we go!
