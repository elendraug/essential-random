title: "Decentralization Corner: Open Badge Edition"
description: |
  Open Badge is a standard to embed cryptographic signature in images. In this edition
  of decentralization corner we'll explore how public/private key encryption works, 
  how it can be used to validate the source of information, and attempt to cryptographically  
  sign the web badges we offered as reward for FujoCoded LLC's founding campaign!
