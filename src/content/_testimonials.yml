  - message: I couldn't have gotten me and my website from crappy wix site with absolute 0 code knowledge, to a selfcoded git and vercel integration without Ms. Boba!
  - message: Ms. Boba has always had a knack for solving problems with creative ideas. When I met her, her knowledge in code and unshakable passion were inspiring. She's dedicated to her work and brings projects to life that benefit the "all" more than the "self". Her enthusiasm is infectious and helps to keep teams and projects running all the way to completion. I believe with her work ethic and skills she will continue to make great things for connecting on the internet!
  - message: Ms. Boba is an accomplished coder, developer, consultant, and all around cool person. I would ask her for advice in a heartbeat, because she always brings a unique perspective to everything she's involved with. She has great ideas and knows how to put them in motion. She's also one of the nicest people I've ever worked with. If she could adopt me, I'd be signing the paperwork already.
  - message: Ms. Boba is possibly one of the most positive, encouraging, and supportive people you'll ever meet. If you think you can't do something, don't worry, because she'll never think that. She spends a *lot* of her time empowering people to learn coding, doing streaming lessons, and talking you through projects, just because she thinks everyone is capable... and she does it for free. Ms. Boba has helped me think more about what I want from the internet and what I can do to make it happen!
  - message: I trust Ms Boba's efforts to shape better spaces for fandom to succeed because she makes thoughtful, deliberate decisions about user experience - not just based on her own wants and needs, but based on the feedback of people with experiences different than her own. She knows that you can't please everyone, but does trust that everyone has something valuable to say, and ultimately is looking to build a fandom tools that can be adaptable to a variety of wants and needs. She knows that slow and steady will win the race because it will give us stable tools.

As a Fandom Old and a software engineer, she has a unique set of skills to create an oasis in the ever-increasing sea of hostile advertising-driven fandom spaces. She's more prepared than most for the herculean task of building a community-based fandom space for users to make their own little haven.

      Ms Boba has first-hand professional Silicon Valley FAANG expertise on the tech side and "trash panda" expertise on the fandom side. Most people trying to do fandom projects usually only have one of those skillsets, and then get completely fucked up by not knowing anything about the other skillset.
      I don't know anyone else working on a nascent fandom project that has both these skillsets. This makes her uniquely positioned to responsibly and competently wield the necessary Big Tech skills (such as networking + recruiting + estimating + training, and other "starting/running a tech project" needs -- a lot more than just programming) for a fandom tech-based passion project.

      Ms. Boba is the only person I've seen approach building a social media site or a fan community with an actual grounded, realistic eye towards the future. The sheer amount of work and effort Ms. Boba has put into building bobaboard is staggering, and I am not referring to the coding or any of the technical aspects. Ms. Boba is ACTUALLY working her ass off to build a community and helping break down the obstacles that stop people from becoming involved or succeeding, she's not just someone excited about their shiny new toy or trying to sell a product. Ms. Boba is clearly in it for the long haul, and it gives me a lot of hope that a lot of good can come out of bobaboard.
