    You can keep that, and be automatically enrolled in the &quot;almond
    butter toast&quot; support tier as a thank you for donating before it
    was cool.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to up your amount, you can cancel that subscription and
    create a new one. As long as it&apos;s using the same email, I&apos;ll
    make a note to leave you at least as &quot;almond butter toast&quot;,
    regardless of amount.
