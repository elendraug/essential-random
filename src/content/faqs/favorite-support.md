You do you. [Patreon](https://patreon.com/user?u=87081842) takes a certain percentage of the earnings <strike>plus
they are a shitty company</strike>. I like [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/essentialrandomness) more, but their API is (also)
very restrictive. If you can love (moderate) adventure, join my attempt [at a third, custom thing](#donate).
