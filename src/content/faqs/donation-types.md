title: How does this differ from the donations on your main website?
order: 400

Subscriptions on my main website (
<a href="https://essentialrandomness.com/subscribe/">
essentialrandomness.com
</a>
) are backed by Ghost, the blogging software I used to run the initial
version of my newsletter. I&apos;m not a huge fan of Ghost, so
I&apos;m running my own software now. The money ends in the same
place.
