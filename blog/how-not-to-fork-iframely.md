# How not to fork

Here is how I avoided forking iframely!

1. First of all, they don't release a package. So I added the thing directly to my package.json with `yarn add`.
2. Then I wrote a script that runs it from there.
3. Now I'm trying to get it to work with typescript.

Is this a crime? Might be.
